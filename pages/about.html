    <p class="heading">Our Story</p>
    <div class="info">
        Jeevatan Foundation was founded on the premises of Vasantiben and Chandubhai Patel English School through the convergence of three impactful student initiatives: Feed The Need, CleanWave, and Threads of Knowledge. Each began with a simple idea and a strong will to make a difference.
        <br><br>
        <b>Feed The Need</b>
        <br>
        Launched in July 2024 by Dhairya Pandya and B. Maheshwaran, Feed The Need is a community kitchen project dedicated to eradicating hunger and malnutrition at the grassroots level. It began with students distributing home-cooked meals along Sanket Road in Anand. As the initiative gained momentum, our school kitchen joined in to prepare the meals, while Charutar Vidya Mandal (CVM) began providing weekly transportation for food and volunteers.
        <br><br>
        <b>CleanWave</b>
        <br>
        Started in September 2024 by Tiam Patel, Manan Shah, Rishi Patel, and Yash Patel, CleanWave originated as a local park cleanup effort. It quickly expanded into a school-wide environmental movement focused on tackling plastic pollution. Weekly collection drives were launched, with all plastic waste sent to Meemansa for recycling. CleanWave continues to instill eco-consciousness and a sense of responsibility among students.
        <br><br>
        <b>Threads of Knowledge</b>
        <br>
        Initiated in December 2024 by the entire Jeevatan team, Threads of Knowledge aims to provide holistic, co-curricular, and skill-based education to underprivileged children. The initiative equips them with the knowledge and skills necessary to build a brighter and more self-reliant future.
        <br><br>
        <b>Coming Together</b>
        <br>
        In December 2024, the founders of Feed The Need and CleanWave recognized the potential for a greater collective impact. By merging their efforts, they formed Jeevatan Foundation — a unified platform for sustainable change. This collaboration has allowed us to expand our outreach, pool our resources, and amplify the impact of our work across multiple fronts.
        <br><br>
        <b>Our Support System</b>
        <br>
        Jeevatan Foundation thrives thanks to the unwavering support of our community. We are deeply grateful to:
        <br>
        <ul style="margin-left: 3vw;">
            <li>Vasantiben & Chandubhai Patel English School</li>
            <li>Charutar Vidya Mandal</li>
            <li>Meemansa</li>
            <li>Our friends, families, and fellow students</li>
        </ul>
        Their encouragement and resources have been instrumental in scaling our initiatives.
        <br><br>
        <b>Expanding Our Reach</b>
        <br>
        In our efforts to reach more communities, we partnered with Prathmik Shala, Bhaikaka Nagar. The school’s principal and teachers welcomed us wholeheartedly and supported our educational sessions. As a result, students now participate in weekly learning programs followed by nutritious food distribution.
        <br>
        Additionally, we extended our CleanWave message to the school. The students pledged to stop burning plastic and instead collect it for recycling through our initiative — a small change that’s already making a meaningful difference.
